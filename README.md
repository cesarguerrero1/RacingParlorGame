# Racing Parlor Game
This game was builty using the 2D Unity Engine, version 2019.4.26f1

The entire premise is a simple racing game where you can bet against 3 other players on who you think will win the race. This was inspired by Head First C#, in which they guide you in building a similar program directly in the Visual Studio IDE.

All code is my own and the only 3rd party asset I used is a free asset created by Ansimuz, "Stomper Platform Assets." I only used the dinosaur sprite in my game.
